Don't you just love the .Net buttons ? This is a painfully shy attempt to emulate the buttons, I'm doing it 'coz I was bored. It lacks a lot of functions but it gets the job done :) Anyway, most of it were done using the wizard that comes with VB6.0. Hope you guys like it ..... if you people really want a super cool .Net button try getting it from 

www.vbsmart.com

that button over there is awesome and my buttons is a pale comparison to it :) hahahahha, anyway, hope you guys love it.

Note : Images should be 16X16, i made this for 16X16 icons :)

Fix : Apparently the button click event was not working ... my mistake.
      It should be working now .....*fingers crossed*

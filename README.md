### Description

Its a button .... what else does a button do ?

Note : I have fixed the click event problem :) My mistake ..... who else would it be ?
 
### More Info
 
Don't you just love the .Net buttons ? This is a painfully shy attempt to emulate the buttons, I'm doing it 'coz I was bored. It lacks a lot of functions but it gets the job done :) Anyway, most of it were done using the wizard that comes with VB6.0. Hope you guys like it ..... if you people really want a super cool .Net button try getting it from

www.vbsmart.com

that button over there is awesome and my buttons is a pale comparison to it :) hahahahha, anyway, hope you guys love it. Any contructive feedback is welcomed .....
